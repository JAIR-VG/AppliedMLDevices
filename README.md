# Introduction
Using records obtained from Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit, we will build a machine learning model to predict personal activity. The dataset contains several measurements, such as accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell. This report is organized as follows: first, exploratory analysis is performed. Next, a data preprocessing step is applied to get a tidy dataset. Then, a machine learning model is built and tested. Finally, conclusions are presented.
